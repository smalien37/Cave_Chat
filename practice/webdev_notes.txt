<hr/> -> this is a horizontal rule or line & they are self closing tag or void tags
<br/> or <br> -> breka line both are working

<ul>  -> Unordered List

<ul>
    <li>YOLO</li>
    <li> hey bro</li>
</ul>
-> here u will get bullet ponts


<ol>   -> Ordered LIST
    <li>YOLO</li>
    <li> hey bro</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Hiiiii</li>
        </ul>
    
    </li>
</ol>
-> here u will get Numbering

We can have nesded Lists as well


dragabble Attribute -> set this as true or false & then we can drag any tag

So we need to start our ordered List from a desired Number say: 5 or 10 
we can use an attribute called: start = "5"
